# MakeHuman

The makehuman_release repo is a git mirror/clone/fork of the official makehuman repo (stable branch). 
It does not contain any revision history prior to the release of 1.1.0. It is updated with one full commit per new stable release.

Thus you will not find unstable/development code here, only code such as it looked at the latest stable release.

The "live" makehuman repo is in mercurial at https://bitbucket.org/MakeHuman/makehuman
